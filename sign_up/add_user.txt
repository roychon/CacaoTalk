1. Validate the form data
    - if invalid, send them back to sign_up.php
        - $_POST array is not empty
            - if not empty, check username, email, password, password confirm are ALL not empty
                - use regex once more (filter_var for email)
    - if valid, connect to DB
    - prepare INSERT query
    - bind params and execute (HASH password here)

    - if everything goes well, send them back to sign_in.php
    - if something was not good, send them back to sign_up.php with an error message
